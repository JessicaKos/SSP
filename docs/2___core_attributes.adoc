=== Model name

*Atrribute descroption:* Human-readable way to refer to the model. Typically short and clear. Not necessarily unique. To be distinguished from the model identifier and the file name.

*Cardinality:* 1 (mandatory)

*Value entry examples:*

* Electric motor/generator 
* Mapped Motor
* Permanent magnet DC machine
* 2nd order mass

*Additional explanation and rationale:* From a user's perspective, the model name is the most important characteristic of a model. A model name is easier to remember than a generic identifier, and when users want to search for or retrieve models, they search primarily by model name. When models are imported into a data management system, the system typically expects a model name as a mandatory attribute.
