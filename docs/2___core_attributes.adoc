== MIC Core Attributes [[mic-core-attributes]]

TODO: Description of all core attributes in long form, tabular summary will be auto-generated.

=== Administrative data

==== Model name

*_Attribute category:_* Administrative data

*Atrribute descroption:* Human-readable way of referring to the model. Usually short and clear. Not necessarily unique. To be distinguished from the model identifier and file name.

*_Cardinality:_* 1 (mandatory)

*_Value entry examples:_*

* Electric motor/generator

* Mapped Motor

* Permanent magnet DC machine

* 2nd order mass

*_Additional explanation and rationale:_* From a user's perspective, the model name is the most important characteristic of a model. A model name is easier to remember than a generic identifier, and when users want to search for or retrieve models, they search primarily by model name. When models are imported into a data management system, the system typically expects a model name as a mandatory attribute. 

==== Model identifier

*_Attribute category:_* Administrative data

*_Attribute descrption:_* Unique identifier for the model. Possibly only locally unique. May not be specific to a given version of the model. The syntax and interpretation of the identifier is not standardized and open to the implementer. Can for example be based on a URI, a model path, or a UUID.

*_Cardinality:* 0..1 (recommended)

*Value entry examples:_*

* part.Engine.combustion.BMW_S58Engine

* 4fc009cc-2dae-4df9-b6b2-0b535038c8e8

* //server/home/user/models/mymodel

*_Additional explanation and rationale:_* The model identifier, unlike the model name, is typically unchangeable and usually unique within an IT system's number range. This means that if a model is sent multiple times, it can have a different version number each time, while the model identifier is the same. Thus, the model identifier can be used to identify different model versions as versions of the same model, or to identify that there are two versions of different models. The model identifier is the most important and decisive attribute when importing models into a data management system and therefore must be provided for technical reasons.

==== Model description

*_Attribute category:_* Administrative data

*Attribute description:* Human readable, textual, general overview. Highlights important information about the model. May include some information formalized in other attributes, without expectation of completeness. 

*_Cardinality:_* 0-1 (recommended)

*Value entry examples:* For the recipient of a simulation model, a textual description or summary of the model's contents and possible uses may be helpful. A quick overview avoids having to look at all the attributes.

* This model simulates the heat exchange between S58 engine and cooling system

* DRVELMT01 is a model of electric motor/generator with its converter. The output torque and power losses can be determined either by using data files or  characteristic parameters. This model is bidirectional.

*_Additional explanation and rationale:_* Submitting this attribute is recommended to help the receiver of the model understand the model.

==== Release 

*_Attribute descrption:_* Preferably human-readable, unique identifier for the release of a particular simulation model. Required to distinguish between different releases of models. Represents the result of the intentional act of releasing a model at a particular stage to a particular audience (different from the more general notion of version).

*_Cardinality:_* 1 (mandatory)

*_Value entry examples:_*

* V3.2.4
* 0.1a
* 1.2.0-alpha.1+build.x64.010
* Version 10.0.19044 Build 19044
* 1.9.9.12-DB:C5:D9:3F:DA:19:C5:82:40:80:8B:A5:33:A4:DC:5F


*_Additional explanation and rationale:_* The release should be specified in any case to help the recipient of the model to distinguish between different releases. The specification of the release is also important to facilitate the communication of development partners regarding the model.

=== Release date

*_Attribute descrption:_*  Date on which a simulation model was released. Must respect ISO 8601.

*_Cardinality:_* 0..1 (recommended)

*_Value entry examples:_*

* 2023-03-27T12:27:04Z

*_Additional explanation and rationale:_* If there are multiple releases of a model and the releases do not differ in name, the release date is often a helpful differentiator. It may also be possible to determine which release is the most recent. Therefore, it is recommended to include the release date to assist the recipients of the release.

=== Release type

*_Attribute descrption:_*  Relates to the maturity of the model. To be distinguished from a changing status (e.g. outdated). Fixed at the time of the release and not changing. Allows the receiver to evaluate the usage limitations of a given release (e.g. a prelease shall not be used for final system validation).

*_Cardinality:_* 0..1 (recommended)

*_Value entry examples:_*

* internal-release

* pre-release

* * production release

* only for demonstration

* *_Bad examples:_* outdated, optimization model

*_Additional explanation and rationale:_* Specifying the release type gives the receiver of the release an indication of the status that the sender of the release assigns to the release.

=== Model supplier

*_Attribute descrption:_*  The responsible body and, if applicable, organizational unit within the body, that is responsible for supplying the model. Can be different from the owner or the creator of the model. Should be defined in a durable way, avoiding for example specific people names.  Relevant personal data protection guidelines should be takend into account. In case of model assembly, responsible of the overall assembly.

*_Cardinality:_* 1 (mandatory)

*_Value entry examples:_*

* company Z, department SD

* company-Z-models@dd.com

* www.company-Z/models

* personal data, e.g. company Z, Peter Miller can be problem

*_Additional explanation and rationale:_* The attribute is classified as mandatory because it is very important to know who provided the model, and because it is important to be able to contact the model provider in case of questions about the model. Otherwise, the use of the model may be made very difficult or even impossible.

=== Model confidentiality level

*_Attribute descrption:_*  Protection level to apply to the model. Does not specify the organizational scope. Does not define what a receiver is allowed to do or is not allowed to do. Values should be "0: public", "1: internal", "2: confidential" or "3: strictly confidential".  Additional processes and tools are required to ensure confidentiality.

Note: Reference to ISO/IEC 27010:2015

*_Cardinality:_* 1 (mandatory)

*_Value entry examples:_*

* 0: public
* 1: internal
* 2: confidential 
* 3: strictly confidential

*_Additional explanation and rationale:_*
