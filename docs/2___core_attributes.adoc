== MIC Core Attributes

[[mic-core-attributes]]

TODO: Description of all core attributes in long form, tabular summary will be auto-generated.

This chapter introduces and describes the list of MIC core attributes. Each attribute is introduced with a general description and an indication of the attribute obligation, i.e., whether the attribute is mandatory, recommended, or optional, and whether the attribute can be instantiated multiple times or not. To enhance the understanding of an attribute, some value examples and additional explanation or rationale for the attribute are provided where applicable.

The attributes are organized by the following attribute groups:

* Administrative data

* Purpose and objectives

* Subject information

* Modeling implementation

* Verification and validation

=== Administrative data

The Administrative Data category contains information used to identify and organize the models. For example, this may include the name, ID, and version information of the model. Administrative data also includes information about the authorization to use the model and the level of confidentiality of the model.

==== Model name

Attribute description:: Human-readable way of referring to the model. Usually short and clear. Not necessarily unique. To be distinguished from the model identifier and file name.

Obligation:: Mandatory

Can have multiple values:: No

Value examples::

* Electric motor/generator

* Parametrized motor

* Permanent magnet DC machine

* 2nd order mass

Additional explanation and rationale:: From a user's perspective, the model name is an important characteristic of a model. A model name is easier to remember than an identifier, and model names play an important role when searching for or retrieving models. When models are imported into a data management system, the system typically expects a model name as a mandatory attribute. 

==== Model identifier

Attribute description:: Unique identifier for the model. Possibly only locally unique, within a given IT system. May not be specific to a given release of the model. The syntax and interpretation of the identifier is not standardized and open to the implementer. Can for example be based on a URI, a model path, or a UUID.

Obligation:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* part.Engine.combustion.BMW_S58Engine

* 4fc009cc-2dae-4df9-b6b2-0b535038c8e8

* //server/home/user/models/mymodel

Additional explanation and rationale:: The model identifier, unlike the model name, is typically unchangeable. Different releases of a model may have the same model identifier is the same. In this case, both the model identifier and the model release are required for model desambiguation.

==== Model description

Attribute description:: Human-readable, textual, general overview. Highlights important information about the model. May include some information formalized in other attributes, without expectation of completeness. 

Obligation:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples:: 

* This model simulates the heat exchange between S58 engine and cooling system

* DRVELMT01 is a model of electric motor/generator with its converter. The output torque and power losses can be determined either by using data files or  characteristic parameters. This model is bidirectional.

Additional explanation and rationale:: For the recipient of a simulation model, a textual description or summary of the model's contents and possible uses may be helpful. A quick overview avoids having to look at all the attributes.

==== Release 

Attribute description:: Unique identifier, preferably human-readable (i.e. semantically meaningfull), for the release of a particular simulation model. Represents the result of the intentional act of releasing a model at a particular stage to a particular audience (different from the more general notion of version).

Obligation:: Mandatory

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* V3.2.4
* 0.1a
* 1.2.0-alpha.1+build.x64.010
* Version 10.0.19044 Build 19044
* 1.9.9.12-DB:C5:D9:3F:DA:19:C5:82:40:80:8B:A5:33:A4:DC:5F

Additional explanation and rationale:: A human-readable release can help the recipient of the model and, more generally, the development stakeholders.

==== Release date

Attribute description::  Date, and possibly time and timezone, of the release of a simulation model. Must respect ISO 8601.

Obligation:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* 2023-03-27T12:27:04Z

Additional explanation and rationale:: Release dates permit to clarify the chronolgy of releases (How old is a simulation model? What simulation model came first? etc.).

==== Release type

Attribute description::  Relates to the maturity of the model. To be distinguished from a changing status (e.g. outdated). Fixed at the time of the release and not changing. Allows the receiver to evaluate the usage limitations of a given release (e.g. a prelease shall not be used for final system validation).

Obligation:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* internal-release

* pre-release

* production release

* only for demonstration

==== Model supplier

Attribute description::  The responsible body and, if applicable, organizational unit within the body, that is responsible for supplying the model. Can be different from the owner or the creator of the model. Should be as specific as possible but also durable, avoiding for example specific people names. Relevant personal data protection guidelines should be takend into account. In case of model assembly, responsible of the overall assembly.

Obligation:: Mandatory

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* company Z, department SD

* company-Z-models@dd.com

* www.company-Z/models

* personal data, e.g. company Z, Peter Miller can be problematic

Additional explanation and rationale:: The attribute is classified as mandatory because it is very important to know who provided the model, and because it is important to be able to contact the model provider in case of questions about the model.

==== Model confidentiality level

Attribute description:: Protection level to apply to the model. Does not specify the organizational scope. Does not define what a receiver is allowed to do or is not allowed to do. Values should be "0: public", "1: internal", "2: confidential" or "3: strictly confidential".  Additional processes and tools are required to ensure confidentiality.

Obligation:: Mandatory

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* 0: public
* 1: internal
* 2: confidential 
* 3: strictly confidential

Additional explanation and rationale:: While such a confidentiality level is less relevant for cross-enterprise model exchange, it is highly relevant for intra-enterprise sharing.

==== Legal restriction

Attribute description::  Defines the rules governing the distribution and usage of the simulation model, including licensing, in the form of an open field: royalties to pay, restriction to noncommercial use, right to modify, related legal contract, etc.

Obligation:: Optional

Can have multiple values:: Yes

Value entry examples::

* Company Z confidential
* GPL
* License MIT
* Legal contract #0987654321

Additional explanation and rationale:: Information about legal restrictions can help avoid legal uncertainties in the use of models. However, since such restrictions do not always exist, this attribute is optional.

=== Purpose and objectives

Information in the category Purpose and Objectives describe the purpose for which the model is designed and what may be simulated with the model with which objective. This may be formulated quite generally, for example "Simulation of the electrical behavior of a DC motor". However, it may also be much more specific, for example "Simulation of the ramp-up current characteristics of a DC motor", if the model allows a very high sampling rate of the electrical current.

==== Model purpose

Attribute description::  Purpose for which the model has been built/validated. Free textual field for short human-readable description.

Obligation:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* Minimization of the maximum value of an engine's energy consumption 

* Evaluation of the average breaking distance under uncertain weather conditions

* Automated driving function validation in an OEM environment at object-list level

* Efficency evaluation of a gear box in combination with a SW-function

=== Subject information

Subject information is information that names the modeled concrete object, for example an individual system or product component, a system, an entire product or an assumed object from the environment of a product. This could be, for example, a very specific DC motor, an electronic vehicle stabilization system in a specific configuration, a specific vehicle type, or even a hypothetical pedestrian with a specific, specifically described set of properties.

==== Modelled entity

Attribute description::  Name or description of the object represented by the simulation model.

Obligation:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* Camera
* Gear box type xyz23
* Electrical car, model X, version Y, configuration Z

Additional explanation and rationale:: The modelled entity can typically be a system whose development is supported by simulation. There may not be any specific modelled ententy when a simulation rather represents general physical phenomena.

=== Modelling implementation

Information from the modeling implementation category describes how the model was created or how it should be created. This includes, for example, information on the modeling language and the modeling tool and, if necessary, on the compiler used. This can also include a description of the modeling approach.

==== Modeling choice

Attribute description::  Explanation of the modeling choices, assumptions or simplifications made during the implementation of the model. It should include: 

1) effects or phenomena covered  introduced in general terms, such as vibration of thermal effects, and detailed;

2) how they are covered (in an acausal approach, with a look-up table based on experimental data, etc.).

3) typical keywords which permit to facilitate information retrieval (e.g. “Causal”, “Acausal”, “Bond graph”, “Transfer function”).

Obligation:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: Yes

Value entry examples::

Note: As this attribute can have multiple values, some of the examples below could apply together to the same model:

* Sensor model is purely object-list driven

* Weather effects are not modelled.

* Typical hydraulic fluid is used, the medium is isotropic

* Acausal thermal and electrical modelling with through and accross variables

* The car is represented as a single track model

* The motor is modeled with a look-up table based on experimental data 

==== Modeling limitations + + +  ATTENTION: Name differs fron Excel table entry + + +  

Attribute description::  Restrictions on the use of the model. Especially important if these restrictions are not self-evident to a user (e.g. when the model provides an incorrect result). 

Obligation:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: Yes

Value entry examples::

* The model is only valid between 0 and 50 degrees temperature

* Not real-time capable

* The model provides incorrect results at low speeds

* Eddy currents are neglected

* Thermal effects are not considered

==== Model classification

Attribute description:: Keyword-based classifications of the model in terms, for example, of physics, engineering or implementation. Can refer to standard or locally standard schemes. It is recommended to refer to a scheme with the reverse domain notation prefix.

Obligation:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: Yes

Value entry examples::

* Linear

* org.modelica.causality.acausal

* org.iso.is11010-1.vhm.2-1

=== Verification and validation

The information in the Verification and Validation category takes into account all aspects of model quality assurance, for example whether certain standards have been met or are to be met and what additional measures have been taken and checks have been or should be met. 

==== Verification status

Attribute description::  Indicates whether a given verification procedure has been followed to successfully reach verification criteria. Verification permits to confirm that a simulation technically works (code without bug, convergence of discretized models, etc.).

Obligation:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* has been verified

* has not be verified

Additional explanation and rationale:: Incentive to verify the model. As verification can cover various aspects, rely on various techniques and be more or less constraining, details should be provided with the attribute "Verification & Validation procedure and criteria" and "Verification & Validation report".

==== Validation status

Attribute description:: Indicates whether a given validation procedure has been followed to successfully reach validation criteria. Validation permits to confirm that a simulation fulfills user needs. For example, validation permits to confirm that a simulation is close enough to a reference given particular needs.

Obligation:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* has been validated

* has not been validated

* validated with limitations

Additional explanation and rationale:: Incentive to validate the model. As validation can cover various aspects, rely on various techniques and be more or less constraining, details should be provided with the attribute "Verification & Validation procedure and criteria" and "Verification & Validation report".

==== Verification & Validation procedure and criteria

Attribute description:: Steps and methods followed as well as criteria to reach. Verification and validation can be covered together or separately.

Obligation:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: Yes

Value entry examples::

* ASME VV10

* ASME VV40

* Scale 2 of he NASA verification scale

* Turing Test

* Graphical Comparisons

==== Verification & Validation report

Attribute description:: Reports describing the results of the verification and validation. Verification and validation can be covered together or separately. Can be summaries, to facilitate communication and distribution. Typically a link to a report.

Obligation:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: Yes

Value entry examples::

* link Report XS

Additional explanation and rationale:: A Inspecting the reports may help deciding wheather the validation and verification fulfill the expectatioons in detail with respect to the intended usage in a certain use case. Hence, it is recommended to provuide the report if, available.

=== Attributes without defined category 

==== Software and hardware environment requirements + + + ATTENTION: Still incomplete and incosistent + + +
