== Mapping of MIC-Core to SSP Traceability SRMD Format

=== Introduction

In the following, an exemplary implementation of the MIC-Core standard into the SRMD metadata format will be shown.
The SRMD (Simulation Resoure Meta Data) metadata format is a subset of the SSP traceability STMD (Simulation Task Meta Data) format. These formats are part of the Modelica Association Project SSP (System Structuring and Parametrization).
The SRMD format allows to specify any metadata, attributes in the form of key value pairs. The format description also specifies where this metadata file should be stored in an FMU or SSP (link to SSP traceability).

=== Maping of MIC-Core attributes to the SRMD format

The following table shows the implementation.
In the first column the attributes defined in the MIC core are listed.
The second column lists the conversion of the attribute names to SRMD. For easier machine processability, clustering via presented terms separated by period is used here. No spaces are used.
In column 3 an abbreviated explanation of the attributes is listed

|===
| MIC-Core Name| SRMD Mapping | Short Explanation
| Model name | administrative-data.model.name | Human-readable way of referring to the model. Usually short and clear. Not necessarily unique
| Model identifier | administrative-data.model.identifier | Unique identifier for the model.
| Model description | administrative-data.model.description | Human-readable, textual, general overview. Highlights important information about the model.
| Model supplier | administrative-data.model.supplier | The responsible body and, if applicable, organizational unit within the body, that is responsible for supplying the model.
| Model confidentiality level | administrative-data.model.confidentiality-level | Protection level to apply to the model.
| Legal restriction | administrative-data.legal-restriction | Defines the rules governing the distribution and usage of the simulation model, including licensing,
| Release | administrative-data.release | Unique identifier, preferably human-readable (i.e. semantically meaningfull), for the release of a particular simulation model.
| Release date | administrative-data.release.date | Date, and possibly time and timezone, of the release of a simulation model. Must respect ISO 8601.
| Release type| administrative-data.release.type | Relates to the maturity of the model.
| Model purpose | purpose-objectives.model | Purpose for which the model has been built/validated.
| Modelled entity | subject-information.modelled-entity | Name or description of the object represented by the simulation model.
| Modeling choice | implementation.modeling-choice | Explanation of the modeling choices, assumptions or simplifications made during the implementation of the model.
| Model limitations | implementation.model.limitations | Restrictions on the use of the model.
| Model classification | implementation.model.classification | Keyword-based classifications of the model in terms, for example, of physics, engineering or implementation.
| Software and hardware environment requirements | implementation.software-hardware-environment-requirements | Requirements regarding the software and hardware environment of the model.
| Verification status | verification-validation.verification-status | Indicates whether a given verification procedure has been followed to successfully reach verification criteria.
| Validation status | verification-validation.validation-status | Indicates whether a given validation procedure has been followed to successfully reach validation criteria.
| Verification & Validation procedure and criteria | verification-validation.procedure-criteria | Steps and methods followed as well as criteria to reach. Verification and validation can be covered together or separately.
| Verification & Validation report | verification-validation.report | Reports describing the results of the verification and validation.

=== XML SRMD-Schema for MIC-Core

In the following the according XML SRMD schema is shown.

=== Example

In the following a little example is shown.
At the section “verification-validation.report” it is shown how multiple entries of an attribute are handled.
It is also shown how with the type approach of the SRMD format different name spaces or mixing of classifications from different standards, company specific classifications can be handled.
